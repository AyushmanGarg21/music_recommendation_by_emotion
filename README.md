# Music Recommendation System using Emotion Recognition

This project is a music recommendation system that utilizes emotion recognition to recommend songs based on the user's mood.

## Features
 - Developed and implemented a Music Recommendation System utilizing Emotion Recognition technology.
 - Utilized the FER-2013 and Oahega datasets for emotion recognition training in conjunction with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
 - Designed and deployed a user-friendly web frontend and interface for real-time emotion capture leveraging Streamlit and OpenCV.
 - Integrated music datasets to recommend songs based on emotional states using cosine similarity algorithms.

## Dataset
- FER2013 dataset for emotion recognition.
- OHAHEGA dataset for additional emotion data .
- music dataset for music recommendation (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/music-dataset-1950-to-2019).
